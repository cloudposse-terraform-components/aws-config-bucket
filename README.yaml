# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This module creates an S3 bucket suitable for storing `AWS Config` data.

  It implements a configurable log retention policy, which allows you to efficiently manage logs across different storage
  classes (_e.g._ `Glacier`) and ultimately expire the data altogether.

  It enables server-side encryption by default.

  It blocks public access to the bucket by default.

  **Stack Level**: Regional

  Here's an example snippet for how to use this component. It's suggested to apply this component to only the centralized
  `audit` account.

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      config-bucket:
        vars:
          enabled: true
          name: "config"
          noncurrent_version_expiration_days: 180
          noncurrent_version_transition_days: 30
          standard_transition_days: 60
          glacier_transition_days: 180
          expiration_days: 365
  ```
